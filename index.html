    <h2>About Me</h2>
    The first job I ever had was at a supermarket working customer service. Most of my jobs were retail until I
    discovered
    the banking industry. I was in banking for a number of years, specifically in new accounts both business and
    perosnal,
    and loan management. I also did some work in their trust department which was actually really interesting. I made a
    big move and had to switch jobs. I ended up having to get a retail job to keep my move and goals on track. After
    working in that job for two years and working in customer service for <span class="emphasis"> 15 years</span>, I
    decided it was time to make a change.
    I love working with people and being on a team, however customer service jobs that cater to the vast public can get
    tiresome and I decided I needed a change. I wanted to feel challenged in my work and accomplished when I could
    actually
    see the fruits of my labor. I have friends who are in the tech industry and they really enjoy it. Listening to their
    experiences made me feel this industry would provide everything I was looking for:
    <ul>
      <li>Working in a team</li>
      <li>Constant flow of new challenges</li>
      <li>The ability to be creative</li>
      <li>Autonomy in the workplace</li>
      <li>Transferrable skills should I want to try something different but still in tech</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I already have a few skills which will benefit me on my journey in tech. Tech is typically a highly collaborative
      industry. My 15 years in customer service, working with both the general public and within a team, has taught me
      how to work well with different personalities and overcome obstacles democratically and with positive intent. I appreciate organization and
      attention to detail and strive to excel in both. Lastly, my time spent in the banking industry has engrained in me a sense of urgency and awareness when it comes to privacy and security.</p>
    <p>This industry will also allow me to have time to balance work and my personal life. I have a sweet, big ol'
      German
      Shepherd mix and we love to go out in the forest and hike. One of my favorite things to do in the forest is
      hunt
      for mushrooms. I have been mushroom foraging for about 9 years now and there is still more to learn everyday. When
      we aren't in the forest, Tucker and I like to spend our days on the river or just sunbathing in the backyard.
